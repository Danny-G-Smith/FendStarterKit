The trick to this game it to remember the cards or icons and match them in as quickly as you can.

Here is what you do:

- Flip the first card to see what it is.
- Flip the second card, you need to do this fairly quickly.
    - If the cards match, both cards stay exposed so you can see them.
    - If the cards do not match, both will flip back the way they were.
- Keep going until you win or run out of time.

## Game Overview

The game has a deck with 8 pairs of cards, for a total of 16 cards.  When you start a new game, assume:

- Everything is set to zero, except the clock which has 120 seconds.
- The cards have been shuffled so that no two games are the same.

    
### Scoring

    - Matching a pair of cards awards 100 points
